## Overview
In this workshop we will discuss the importance of uncertainty in deep learning for robotic applications. In addition, the workshop will host the 2nd Probabilistic Object Detection challenge, a new challenge that evaluates the ability of visual object detectors to accurately quantify their spatial and semantic uncertainty.

The workshop will provide tutorial-style talks that cover the state-of-the-art of uncertainty quantification in deep learning, specifically Bayesian and non-Bayesian approaches, spanning perception, world-modeling, decision making, and actions. Invited expert speakers will discuss the importance of uncertainty in deep learning for robotic perception, but also action. In addition the workshop will provide a forum to discuss novel and ongoing work in a variety of topics:

### Topics of Interest
   * Uncertainty estimation in deep learning for robotic perception (e.g. object detection, instance segmentation)
   * Propagating uncertainty from perception to actions and decisions
   * Uncertainty in Reinforcement Learning
   * Deep learning in safety critical robotic applications
   * Deep learning in open-set conditions
   * The role of uncertainty for active learning, few-shot learning, and lifelong learning
   * Bayesian Deep Learning, deep probabilistic models
   * Adversarial attacks, safety, failure prediction


### Challenge
The workshop will also host the  [2nd Probabilistic Object Detection challenge](object-detection). This is the first object detection challenge requiring a probabilistic aspect for detection: A novel metric evaluates both the spatial and semantic uncertainty of the object detector. Providing reliable uncertainty information is essential for robotics applications where actions triggered by erroneous but high-confidence perception can lead to catastrophic results.
