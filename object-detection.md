## The Robotic Vision Object Detection Challenge
<!-- <h2 class="project-tagline">Evaluating Uncertainty Estimation, Continuous Learning and Active Learning</h2> -->


We will use object detection as a proxy task to evaluate uncertainty estimation, continuous learning, and active learning.


Expect the Robotic Vision Challenge to go live in November 2018. More details will be published by then.
