## The Robotic Vision Scene Understanding Challenge

The Scene Understanding Challenge evaluates how well a robotic vision system can understand its environment by asking questions about objects and their relations.

Possible questions might be:

> Where are my keys?  
>
> Where is the red toy car?
>
> Are there any wine bottles on the table in the living room?
>
> How many plates are on the table in the kitchen?


These questions will be handed to the participants in an easy to parse format that does not require natural language processing.

Expect the Robotic Vision Scene Understanding Challenge to go live in November 2018.
