[The Importance of Uncertainty in Deep Learning for Robotics](iros2019) is the topic of our workshop at IROS 2019.
We will run a second round of the [probabilistic object detection challenge](object-detection). Invited speakers and contributed papers will discuss the importance of uncertainty in deep learning for robotic perception, but also action.



## Past

<a href="cvpr2019.html"><img src="assets/img/CVPR19logo.jpg" width="200" style="float:left; margin-right:10px;"></a>
We are organised a competition and [workshop at CVPR 2019](cvpr2019), introducing the probabilistic object detection challenge. Four participating teams presented their approaches and results. More details and links to their papers can be found on the [workshop website](cvpr2019).
