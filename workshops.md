[The Importance of Uncertainty in Deep Learning for Robotics](iros2019) was the topic of our workshop at IROS 2019.
Invited speakers and contributed papers discussed the importance of uncertainty in deep learning for robotic perception, but also action. We publicly presented our work towards a new [Scene Understanding](scene-understanding) challenge for the first time.

We are organised a competition and [workshop at CVPR 2019](cvpr2019), introducing the probabilistic object detection challenge. Four participating teams presented their approaches and results. More details and links to their papers can be found on the [workshop website](cvpr2019).
